This is a test project to expose the bug(s) described at https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit/issues/343

To test:

 * "bundle install"
 * in one terminal window: "ruby server.rb"
 * in another terminal window: "bundle exec cucumber"
 
Read the result. On my system, I get a number of silly results in place of a 200. (Usually zeros, but also plenty of apparently random numbers).

UPDATE: if you "bundle update" to the latest versions of capybara-webkit, cucumber and sinatra, the problem seems to go away. I'll leave this project around while the capybara-webkit issue is open.
